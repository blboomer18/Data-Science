# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of data science projects, notebooks, and experiments I've completed as part of my coursework and personal learning journey. It showcases my journey and work in data science, including projects on exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and web scraping. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world data, apply machine learning techniques, and visualize findings in a meaningful way.

## Repo Structure

- `Exploratory-Data-Analysis`: Initial data insights, visualizations, and summaries
- `Machine-Learning`: Projects involving supervised and unsupervised models
- `NLP`: Natural Language Processing projects and exercises
- `Course-Labs`: Raw labs from data science coursework

## Technologies & Tools

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, etc.)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Git & GitHub

## Highlights

## Work in Progress

Many of these notebooks are in progress or from coursework. I'm actively cleaning, commenting, and restructuring to better represent my growth and learning.

Thanks for visiting!
