# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome! This repository contains a collection of data science projects, notebooks, and experiments I've completed as part of my coursework and personal learning journey. It showcases my journey and work in data science, including projects on exploratory data analysis, machine learning, and web scraping. The goal is to demonstrate my ability to work with real-world data, apply machine learning techniques, and visualize findings in a meaningful way.

## Repo Structure

- `Exploratory-Data-Analysis`: Initial data insights, visualizations, and summaries
- `Machine-Learning`: Projects involving supervised and unsupervised models
- `NLP`: Natural Language Processing projects and exercises
- `Course-Labs`: Raw labs from data science coursework

## Technologies & Tools

- Programming, Data Analysis & Visualization (Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Folium, Dash, Plotly, etc.)
- Development & Collaboration (Jupyter Notebooks, Git, GitHub, VS Code, Docker)
- Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, TensorFlow & Keras)
- Data Wrangling & SQL (SQLite / PostgreSQL)
- Web Scraping & Automation (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Requests)
- Cloud & APIs (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, REST APIs)

## Highlights

- Capstone Projects: Developed and deployed a Dash web application for SpaceX launch site visualizations, demonstrating interactive data analysis and web development skills.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted in-depth analysis on various real-world datasets, including housing prices and stock market data, using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to derive meaningful insights.
- Machine Learning: Built predictive models for Titanic survival prediction and rainfall prediction, utilizing classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest to forecast outcomes based on historical data.
- Web Scraping: Automated data collection using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to gather and clean data from SpaceX and Chicago crime statistics, showcasing skills in handling unstructured data.
- SQL & Data Wrangling: Applied SQL queries for data cleaning and aggregation in the Chicago Data project, and utilized Pandas for data wrangling and preparation of clean datasets for analysis.
- Geospatial Data: Utilized Folium to create interactive maps, visualizing launch sites and other geospatial data, enhancing understanding of spatial patterns in the data.
- Data Visualization: Designed compelling data visualizations and dashboards to convey complex findings in an intuitive and actionable format, including stock data visualizations and folium-based maps.

## Work in Progress

Many of these notebooks are in progress or from coursework. I'm actively cleaning, commenting, and restructuring to better represent my growth and learning.
