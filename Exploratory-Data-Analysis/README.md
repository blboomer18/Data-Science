# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects. These projects utilize various techniques to explore and analyze data, identify patterns, visualize trends, and prepare datasets for further analysis or machine learning. Each notebook demonstrates different EDA approaches using Python and SQL.

## Notebooks

### 1. **EDA Data Visualization**
   - **File**: [EDA Data Visualization.ipynb](./EDA%20Data%20Visualization.ipynb)
   - **Description**: This notebook demonstrates various data visualization techniques, including bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to explore relationships in the dataset and uncover trends.

### 2. **EDA with SQL**
   - **File**: [EDA w: SQL.ipynb](./EDA%20w%3A%20SQL.ipynb)
   - **Description**: This project showcases how SQL queries can be used to perform exploratory data analysis. It demonstrates querying and manipulating large datasets to extract meaningful insights.

### 3. **Housing Pricing EDA**
   - **File**: [Housing-Pricing-EDA.ipynb](./Housing-Pricing-EDA.ipynb)
   - **Description**: This notebook explores a housing pricing dataset to analyze key factors affecting property prices, including correlation analysis, visualizations, and statistical methods.

### 4. **Stock Data Extraction and Visualization**
   - **File**: [Stock-Data-Extraction-And-Visualization.ipynb](./Stock-Data-Extraction-And-Visualization.ipynb)
   - **Description**: This project focuses on extracting historical stock data and visualizing it to identify trends, moving averages, and other key metrics that influence stock market decisions.

### 5. **Stock Data Extraction**
   - **File**: [Stock-Data-Extraction.ipynb](./Stock-Data-Extraction.ipynb)
   - **Description**: This notebook demonstrates how to extract stock market data from external sources, clean the data, and prepare it for further analysis or use in stock market forecasting.

## Key Concepts Covered
- **Data Visualization**: Using libraries such as **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize data distributions, correlations, and patterns.
- **SQL for EDA**: Leveraging SQL queries to explore and manipulate large datasets efficiently.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding statistical methods like correlation, variance, and regression to draw insights from data.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Analyzing stock market data, including trend visualization and moving averages.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (for querying databases)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for running and sharing analysis
